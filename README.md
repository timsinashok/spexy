## Getting Started

To get started with Spexy, clone the repository and change to the directory. Then follow the setup instructions for both the backend and frontend to run the application locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bipana06/Final_Project_PPDS.git
cd Final_Project_PPDS
```

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Virtual environment package (`venv`)
- MongoDB for data storage

### Running the Backend

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
 To activate the virtual environment use one of the following commands based on your OS: 
 
  On Unix-based systems use:
  ```bash
source env/bin/activate
  ```

On Windows systems use:
  ```bash
env\Scripts\activate
  ```
   

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the `FINAL_PROJECT_PPDS` folder and add your MongoDB URI:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

4. Navigate to the `spexy-backend` directory and run the server using `uvicorn`:

   ```bash
   cd spexy-backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

By default, the backend will start on port `8000`.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system

### Running the Frontend
Start a new terminal and cd into the Final_Project_PPDS directory. 
 ```bash
   cd Final_Project_PPDS
   ```

1. Navigate to the `spexy-frontend` directory :

   ```bash
   cd spexy-frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create and update the `/spexy-frontend/.env` file with your Roboflow API key:
    ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   ```
   REACT_APP_RoboflowAPI=your_roboflow_api
   ```

5. Start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

By default, the frontend will start on port `3000`.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

Create a `.env` file inside the `FINAL_PROJECT_PPDS` folder with the following content:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

### Frontend

Also create `.env` file in the `spexy-frontend` folder:

```
REACT_APP_RoboflowAPI=your_roboflow_api
```
